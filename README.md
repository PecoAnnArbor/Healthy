Healthy is an innovative app designed to empower healthcare providers, even in areas with restricted internet access. Using computer vision, the app allows users to catalog medicine names offline through the camera or photos, storing the detected data in a local iPhone database. When internet connectivity is restored, the app synchronizes the local database with a global database, seamlessly integrating with medical records shared by other users.

The app was inspired by ongoing conflicts where limited connectivity poses challenges for managing medical inventories. By leveraging the simplicity of an iPhone, Healthy offers a practical and accessible solution for doctors to efficiently track and manage their medicine supplies.
